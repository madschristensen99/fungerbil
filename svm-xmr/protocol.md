SOL-XMR Atomic Swap (“Dream-UX” V2)  
Last update: 2025-09-09  

## 1.  Objective  
Let a user holding **USDC/SOL on Solana** swap into **native XMR** (and vice-versa) with **one user action**:  
*“Paste your Monero address → sign one Solana transaction → done.”*  
No temp wallets, no seed phrases, no manual sweeping.

---

## 2.  Roles  
- **Alice** – end-user, signs **one** Solana tx (or off-chain commitment if relayer).  
- **Bob** – headless liquidity maker, signs **one** Monero tx, locks **collateral = exact swap amount**.  
- **Relayer** – optional, pays Solana gas for Alice and is auto-repaid + 5 %.

---

## 3.  Cryptographic building blocks  
| Primitive | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `H = SHA-256(s ‖ 0x01)` | Common hash-lock; `s` 32-byte secret. |
| Cross-group adaptor sig (ed25519 ↔ curve25519) with **canonical form + parity bit** | Solana signature **only reveals** `s` after finalisation; malleability eliminated. |
| Verifiable Timed Commitment (VTC) | Bob encrypts `s` into time-lock puzzle; **24 h** wall-clock timeout (hard-coded). |
| Monero **standard** sub-address | `m = H(A ‖ B ‖ swap-id)`; `A_sub = A + m*G`, `B_sub = B + m*G`; one-time address computed as usual. |

---

## 4.  Direction A – USDC → XMR (Alice sells USDC)

### 4.1  Off-chain setup (< 1 s, SDK)
1. Alice enters **Monero address** `(A,B)`.  
2. SDK shows **exact-amount** quote (no insurance padding).  
3. Alice clicks **“Swap”**.

### 4.2  Commit-reveal relayer protection (optional)
1. Alice signs off-chain `Commit(swap-id, H(usdc_amount, xmr_amount, A_sub))`.  
2. Any relayer posts the commitment (cheap).  
3. Within 30 s the **real** `lock_usdc` must land or commitment expires.

### 4.3  Alice’s single on-chain action  
`lock_usdc` creates a PDA with rules:  
- Release USDC to Bob **iff** valid **canonical** adaptor signature for `H` is posted **and** on-chain adaptor-verify instruction passes.  
- Bob must lock **collateral = exact USDC amount** in same ix.  
- If no XMR lock seen within **24 h** → full refund to Alice (+ relayer fee); Bob collateral returned.  
- After **24 h** anyone can force-open VTC to obtain `s`.  
- If **Bob double-spends his own XMR lock** (≥ 10-block re-org that returns the lock output to him) **and** on-chain fraud proof is submitted → **Bob collateral forfeited to Alice**.  
- Any other ≥ 10-block re-org → no forfeiture; normal 24 h refund window still applies.

### 4.4  Bob’s automated flow
1. Observes PDA → sends XMR to **one-time address** derived from `(A_sub, B_sub)` (one Monero tx).  
2. Waits **10 confirmations**.  
3. Posts **canonical** adaptor signature on Solana; program runs `adaptor_verify` ix:  
   - Checks ed25519 signature is canonical.  
   - Checks discrete-log relation to embedded curve25519 point.  
   - Atomically reveals `s` and releases USDC **plus** collateral to Bob.  
4. Alice now has `s`; she can spend the XMR output at leisure (no race).

### 4.5  Failure / refund paths
- **Bob never locks** → Alice presses **“Refund”** after 24 h (one click); relayer fee & collateral returned.  
- **Bob locks but vanishes before adaptor sig** → any daemon force-opens VTC after 24 h; Alice gets XMR **and** can refund USDC; Bob collateral returned (no fault).  
- **Bob 51 % double-spends his own lock** → anyone submits fraud proof; Bob collateral forfeited to Alice; USDC still refundable after 24 h.

---

## 5.  Direction B – XMR → USDC  
Mirror image with identical constants:  
1. Alice enters **Solana address** `S`.  
2. SDK derives `(A_sub, B_sub)` from `S`.  
3. Alice locks XMR to that one-time address.  
4. After **10 confirmations** she posts **canonical** adaptor sig → reveals `s`, unlocks USDC **plus** exact collateral.  
5. If **Alice double-spends her own XMR lock** (≥ 10-block re-org) → fraud proof forfeits her collateral to Bob.  
6. If no adaptor sig within **24 h** Bob can reclaim USDC; Alice’s locked XMR remains hers to spend (no collateral forfeiture unless she double-spent).

---

## 6.  User-facing summary  

| Direction | Alice Does | Typical Feedback |
|---|---|---|
| USDC → XMR | Paste XMR addr → sign once | “Swap submitted … XMR will arrive in ~25 min.” |
| XMR → USDC | Paste Solana addr → send XMR to shown address | “Send XMR … USDC will appear in ~25 min.” |

No further interaction unless something goes wrong (UI surfaces **“Refund”** button automatically).

## 7.  What could go wrong (updated)

| Scenario | Impact | Mitigation in V2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Adaptor malleability** | Alice gets wrong private key | **FIXED**: canonical form + parity bit enforced on-chain. |
| **VTC brute-force** | Early reveal of `s` | **FIXED**: 24 h wall-clock timeout + Bob collateral slashed if opened early. |
| **Miner 51 % double-spend** | Swap counter-party loses coin & keeps other | **FIXED**: exact-amount collateral forfeited **only** to victim; requires on-chain fraud proof. |
| **Relayer griefing** | Commitment wasted | **FIXED**: 30 s expiry; Alice can retry with new relayer. |
| **Adaptor-sig implementation bug** | Secret leaks from mempool | **FIXED**: on-chain `adaptor_verify` instruction; audited code path. |
| **Bob locks wrong amount** | Alice sees incorrect XMR | She **does not** call `Ready()`; presses **“Refund”** within 24 h; Bob collateral returned. |
| **Alice loses her seed** | She can’t spend `A_sub` | **Same risk as normal Monero**; protocol can’t help—back-up your seed. |

## 8.  On-chain program interface (excerpt)

```rust
/// Verifies ed25519 adaptor signature and extracts secret `s`.
/// Fails if sig not canonical or discrete-log relation invalid.
pub fn adaptor_verify(
    ctx: Context<AdaptorVerify>,
    sig: [u8; 64],          // ed25519 adaptor signature
    parity: u8,             // 0 or 1, enforced canonical
    curve_point: [u8; 32],  // curve25519 point embedded in H
) -> Result<[u8; 32]>      // returns secret `s`
```

---

## 9.  Future upgrades
- **FHE light-client**: reduce 10-block wait to 1.  
- **Batch relayer meta-tx**: gas fully abstracted.  
- **Encrypted order book**: match under FHE, amounts & IPs stay private.
